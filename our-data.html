            <h2>What’s Novel About Health+ HR Dashboard</h2>
            <p>The Health+ HR Dashboard is revolutionizing wellness analytics by integrating an unprecedented number of data streams into a single, actionable interface. Unlike traditional platforms, we utilize not only self-reported data but also passive data streams and digital phenotyping to provide a deeper, more accurate understanding of employee well-being. By capturing insights across multiple dimensions—physical activity, stress levels, sleep quality, and even workplace behaviors—our platform empowers HR professionals to make informed, impactful decisions.</p>
            <p>What sets Health+ apart is our ability to bridge the gap between data and action. Our innovative use of passive data ensures minimal burden on employees while delivering real-time analytics. The inclusion of digital phenotyping allows us to detect subtle patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed, ensuring that signs of burnout or stress are caught early. This holistic approach means no blind spots, just actionable insights tailored to your workforce's unique needs.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Digital Phenotyping -->
        <div class="section-card">
            <i class="fas fa-brain" style="color: #FFC107;"></i>
            <h2>What Is Digital Phenotyping and How It Helps with Burnout</h2>
            <p>Digital phenotyping is the continuous collection of data from everyday devices, such as smartphones and wearables, to understand behavioral and physiological patterns. By analyzing data like typing speed, app usage, movement patterns, and even heart rate variability, digital phenotyping provides a window into an individual's mental and physical state. This cutting-edge approach allows us to detect early warning signs of burnout, such as increased stress levels, disrupted sleep patterns, or reduced physical activity.</p>
            <p>For HR professionals, digital phenotyping is a game changer. It enables proactive interventions by identifying at-risk employees before burnout significantly impacts their performance or well-being. With Health+, digital phenotyping works in the background, integrating seamlessly into employees' lives without being intrusive. The result? A data-driven, employee-centered approach to managing workplace wellness that prioritizes prevention over reaction.</p>

        <!-- Section 3: Passive Data Streams -->
        <div class="section-card">
            <i class="fas fa-database" style="color: #28A745;"></i>
            <h2>What Are Passive Data Streams and How Are We Collecting Them?</h2>
            <p>Passive data streams are unobtrusively collected metrics that provide insights without requiring active input from employees. These include step counts, hours of sleep, heart rate, heart rate variability, time spent at home, and even the number of locations visited. These data points are gathered automatically through the Health+ app, which integrates seamlessly with wearables and smartphone sensors to ensure a frictionless user experience.</p>
            <p>By leveraging passive data, Health+ reduces the burden on employees while maximizing the accuracy and granularity of the insights collected. This approach eliminates gaps caused by incomplete or inaccurate self-reporting, providing HR teams with a robust foundation for decision-making. With Health+, your organization can uncover hidden trends and correlations, empowering you to foster a healthier, more productive workforce.</p>
